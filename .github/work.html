<p> Hi, my name is Ryan Desnick and in this blog style post, I will be explaining exactly why I think that Mr. Whalen should be teaching me how to play the popular video game Hearts of Iron IV.</p>

<ul>
    <ul1>I suck.</ul1>
</ul>

<p>To start off simple, I'm just plain bad at this game. There is no way around it. I simply don't have the hours required in this game to keep up with experienced players. For example, I took 100,000 casualties trying to invade Yemen as Italy and I still failed.</p>

<ul>
    <ul2>I want to get better to play with the boys.</ul2>
</ul>

<p>However, despite my horrible game skill, I would like to learn how to get better, that way I can play the game competently and beat my friends. There would be nothing better than to see the look on Eitan Halevi's face as all his troops are destroyed and his Surface Pro crashes under the might of my sheer army.</p>

<ul>
    <ul3>Mr. Whalen is <strong>GOOD</strong> at HOI.</ul3>
</ul>

<p>Mr. Whalen is a well known gamer and HOI player. With that being said, I have never seen him play, nor do I know the name of his Steam account. However, I have heard many anecdotal accounts of his skill at HOI and the amount of time he has spent in this game.Therefore... </p>

<ul>
    <ul4>Mr. Whalen should teach me how to play HOI.</ul4>
</ul>

<p>Thank you for coming to my TED talk.</p>
